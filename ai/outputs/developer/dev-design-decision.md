*Lightweight decision record for implementation-level choices. Use this when the decision is scoped to a single feature or component. For cross-cutting architectural decisions, use the full ADR template instead.*

---

## Context

*What problem are you solving? What constraints led to this decision point?*

[Describe the implementation problem, the constraints, and why a deliberate decision is needed rather than an obvious choice.]

## Options Considered

| Option                | Pros                            | Cons                              |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| [Option A: name]      | [Key advantage(s)]             | [Key drawback(s)]                |
| [Option B: name]      | [Key advantage(s)]             | [Key drawback(s)]                |
| [Option C: name]      | [Key advantage(s)]             | [Key drawback(s)]                |

## Decision

We will use **[chosen option]** because [one to two sentence rationale linking back to the context and constraints].

---

## Consequences

*What changes as a result of this decision?*

- **Positive:** [What becomes easier, faster, or more reliable]
- **Negative:** [What becomes harder, slower, or riskier]
- **Follow-up work:** [Any tasks created as a result, e.g., "Add adapter layer for future migration"]

## Revisit Trigger

*Under what concrete condition should this decision be reconsidered?*

This decision should be revisited when: [specific, measurable trigger condition].

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Context explains the problem and constraints clearly
- [ ] At least two genuine options are compared with honest pros/cons
- [ ] Decision statement is clear and references the rationale
- [ ] Consequences (positive and negative) are documented
- [ ] Revisit trigger defines a concrete condition
- [ ] Decision is communicated to the team

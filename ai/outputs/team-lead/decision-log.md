# Decision Log

## Metadata

| Field         | Value                          |
|---------------|--------------------------------|
| **Date**      | [YYYY-MM-DD — date log was last updated] |
| **Owner**     | [Team Lead name or persona]    |
| **Project**   | [Project or epic name]         |
| **Related**   | [Links to ADR folder, wiki, or tracker] |
| **Status**    | Draft / Reviewed / Approved    |

*Maintain one decision log per project or epic. Add new rows at the top so the most recent decision is always first. For complex decisions, create a full ADR and link to it here.*

## Decisions

| ID | Date | Decision | Rationale | Decided By | Related ADR / Link | Status |
|----|------|----------|-----------|------------|-------------------|--------|
| [D-001] | [YYYY-MM-DD] | [What was decided] | [Brief reason -- one to two sentences] | [Person or group] | [Link or "N/A"] | Active / Superseded |
| [D-002] | [YYYY-MM-DD] | [What was decided] | [Brief reason -- one to two sentences] | [Person or group] | [Link or "N/A"] | Active / Superseded |
| [D-003] | [YYYY-MM-DD] | [What was decided] | [Brief reason -- one to two sentences] | [Person or group] | [Link or "N/A"] | Active / Superseded |

*Add rows as decisions are made. Keep rationale brief here -- detail belongs in the linked ADR.*

## Superseded Decisions

*When a decision is replaced, move it here or mark its status as "Superseded" and note the replacement.*

| Original ID | Superseded By | Date Superseded | Reason for Change |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| [D-00X]     | [D-00Y]       | [YYYY-MM-DD]    | [Why the original decision was reversed or replaced] |

## Guidance

- **When to log**: Any choice that affects scope, architecture, process, or team assignments.
- **When to write a full ADR**: If the decision is hard to reverse, affects multiple teams, or involves significant trade-offs.
- **Review cadence**: Review this log at the start of each wave or sprint to confirm all active decisions still hold.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Every significant decision has an entry with rationale
- [ ] Complex decisions link to a full ADR
- [ ] Superseded decisions are clearly marked with their replacement
- [ ] Log reviewed at each wave boundary
